Gdye? Kogda?\'\') is an intellectual [[game show]] well known in [[Russian language|Russian-language]] [[Mass media|media]] and other [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS states]] since the mid-1970s. Today it is produced for television by [[TV Igra]] on the Russian [[Channel One (Russia)|Channel One]] and also exists as a competitive game played in clubs organized by the [http://www.chgk.info World Association of Clubs]. Over 21 000 teams worldwide play sport version of game, based on the TV show.&lt;ref&gt;http://ratingnew.chgk.info/teams.php&lt;/ref&gt;<span class="es0">\\n</span><span class="es0">\\n</span>==Format==<span class="es0">\\n</span>Throughout the game, a team of 6 experts attempts to answer questions sent in by viewers. For each question, the time limit is 1 minute. The questions require a combination of skills such as [[logical thinking]], [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], [[insight]], etc. to find the correct answer. The person who sent in the question earns a prize if the experts cannot get the correct answer, while the team of experts earns points if they manage to get the correct answer.&lt;ref name=<span class="es0">\\&quot;</span>thesix-us<span class="es0">\\&quot;</span>/&gt;<span class="es0">\\n</span><span class="es0">\\n</span>The basic rules of the game are:&lt;ref&gt;http://chgk.tvigra.ru/library/?30years&lt;/ref&gt;<span class="es0">\\n</span>* The game is played between a <span class="es0">\\&quot;</span>team of TV viewers<span class="es0">\\&quot;</span> and a team of six experts. Viewers ask questions to the experts, and the experts, during a one-minute discussion, try to find the answer to the given question.<span class="es0">\\n</span>* If the experts answer the question correctly, they earn a point. If their answer is wrong, the viewers\' team gets a point, and the viewer who sent in this question receives a monetary prize. The experts do not receive monetary prizes, except for the best player in case that they win the final game of the series or the year.<span class="es0">\\n</span>* The experts sit around the round table divided into 13 sectors, 12 of which contain envelopes with questions mailed in by viewers and pre-checked for validity, while the 13th sector (see below) indicates a question randomly selected from questions submitted by Internet during the show. Questions from the 13th sector are not pre-checked thus their quality and validity are not guaranteed.<span class="es0">\\n</span>* The arrow on the spinning top selects the sector which will be played next. If the arrow points to a sector which has already been played, the next clockwise sector is selected.<span class="es0">\\n</span>* A question may involve material objects or media (video or audio) demonstrated to the players.<span class="es0">\\n</span>* Sometimes a subject of the question is located inside a <span class="es0">\\&quot;</span>[[black box]]<span class="es0">\\&quot;</span> which is brought into the room and placed on the table but not opened until the correct answer is announced. In this case, the question is usually ended with the phrase <span class="es0">\\&quot;</span>what\'s in the black box?<span class="es0">\\&quot;</span><span class="es0">\\n</span>* The experts may choose to answer the question immediately, avoiding the one-minute discussion. Then, if their answer is correct, they get a reserve minute which can be appended further to discussion of any other question of the game.<span class="es0">\\n</span>* Usually, members of other teams of experts attend the game and informally discuss questions among themselves during the show. Once per game, but only if the viewer\'s team is in the lead, the playing team can ask for help from other players present in the gambling hall. Surprisingly enough, despite the fact that teams actually compete with each other and have no material reasons to assist, the traditions of collaborative work in the club and the spirit of friendship<span class="es0">\\u</span>2014even between members of different teams<span class="es0">\\u</span>2014usually urge them to suggest the best answers they have to the playing team.<span class="es0">\\n</span>* The game continues up to 6 points scored by either side.<span class="es0">\\n</span>* When the experts get 5 points, they may declare <span class="es0">\\&quot;</span>the final round<span class="es0">\\&quot;</span> which means that only one expert remains to play the round. This clears the score, and this question <span class="es0">\\&quot;</span>costs<span class="es0">\\&quot;</span> 6 points. The expert must give the exact answer (any variations are not accepted) to win the game with score 6:0.<span class="es0">\\n</span>* In 2012 series the rule <span class="es0">\\&quot;</span>Minute in credit<span class="es0">\\&quot;</span> was added. The experts may call only if <span class="es0">\\&quot;</span>team of TV viewers<span class="es0">\\&quot;</span> has 5 points. The author of the question get prize anyway. The experts must answer any following question without one minute discussion (or three questions in blitz sectors) or If the experts made score is 5-5 they must answer the last question immediately.<span class="es0">\\n</span><span class="es0">\\n</span>=== Special sectors ===<span class="es0">\\n</span>* \'\'\'<span class="es0">\\&quot;</span>Blitz<span class="es0">\\&quot;</span>\'\'\': three easier questions 20 seconds each. The experts must answer all 3 questions correctly to win the point.<span class="es0">\\n</span>* \'\'\'<span class="es0">\\&quot;</span>Superblitz<span class="es0">\\&quot;</span>\'\'\': same as blitz, but only one player must remain sitting at the table; he or she must answer each of the three questions after 20-second thinking.<span class="es0">\\n</span>* \'\'\'0 (zero)\'\'\' (before 2001). [[Vladimir Voroshilov]] entered the room and asked the question himself (this was the only time where the host could be seen in the show); as he came in, he chose himself one of three questions placed in this sector. In some series the zero sector had the special rule: it was played only if the arrow pointed at it directly, the clockwise rule did not apply. The sector could be played up to 3 times this way. After Voroshilov\'s death this sector has been replaced with the 13th sector.<span class="es0">\\n</span>* \'\'\'The 13th sector\'\'\'. If the top points at the 13th sector, the computer randomly selects one of the questions received on the Internet during the game. The <span class="es0">\\&quot;</span>13th sector<span class="es0">\\&quot;</span> can be played only once in the game.<span class="es0">\\n</span><span class="es0">\\n</span>== Sample questions ==<span class="es0">\\n</span><span class="es0">\\n</span>=== Ordinary sector===<span class="es0">\\n</span>: \'\'\'\'\'Question:\'\'\'\'\' What, according to [[Christopher Morley]], was invented by a woman who had been kissed on the forehead?<span class="es0">\\n</span>: \'\'\'\'\'Answer:\'\'\'\'\' High heels.<span class="es0">\\n</span> <span class="es0">\\n</span>: \'\'\'\'\'Question:\'\'\'\'\' Continue the sequence: love, breath, Rome, estate, column, sense, heaven...<span class="es0">\\n</span>: \'\'\'\'\'Answer:\'\'\'\'\' Wonder. (The question is based upon popular set expressions: the first love, the second breath, the third Rome, the fourth estate, the fifth column, the sixth sense, the seventh heaven, and the eighth wonder.)<span class="es0">\\n</span><span class="es0">\\n</span>: \'\'\'\'\'Question:\'\'\'\'\' The ancient Scandinavians used so called [[kenning]]s, a kind of [[literary trope]]. For example, <span class="es0">\\u</span>201cthe land of the spirit<span class="es0">\\u</span>201d meant the breast and <span class="es0">\\u</span>201cthe land of the whale<span class="es0">\\u</span>201d meant the sea. What did <span class="es0">\\u</span>201cthe land of the [[falcon]]<span class="es0">\\u</span>201d mean?<span class="es0">\\n</span>: \'\'\'\'\'Answer:\'\'\'\'\'  The hand.<span class="es0">\\n</span><span class="es0">\\n</span>=== Black box questions ===<span class="es0">\\n</span><span class="es0">\\n</span>Any question ends: is <span class="es0">\\&quot;</span>What is in the Black box<span class="es0">\\&quot;</span>? In some questions it was another black box and even [[Flight data recorder]] (in Russian the words are the same). There are three black boxes, but the large black box is the ordinary, the smaller (smallest) used only if there are two or three boxes in the question (or in blitz rounds) or the item must \'\'(not would)\'\' be little.<span class="es0">\\n</span><span class="es0">\\n</span>: \'\'\'\'\'Question:\'\'\'\'\' No modern book has aroused so much talk as the one in the black box. What book is it?<span class="es0">\\n</span>: \'\'\'\'\'Answer:\'\'\'\'\' A telephone book.<span class="es0">\\n</span><span class="es0">\\n</span>In big black box was even<span class="es0">\\n</span>* [[Bar code]] (question about EAN standarts)<span class="es0">\\n</span>* vopros_tvigra.ru (as the example of e-mail address)<span class="es0">\\n</span>* Dust (and there is the question, not the [[moth]])<span class="es0">\\n</span><span class="es0">\\n</span>=== Musical questions===<span class="es0">\\n</span>: \'\'\'\'\'Question:\'\'\'\'\' (Two different pieces of music from [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]]<span class="es0">\\u</span>2019s exercises are played to the experts.) The black box contains a thing which can be placed between these two pieces. What is it?<span class="es0">\\n</span>: \'\'\'\'\'Answer:\'\'\'\'\' A mirror. (Either piece is the reverse version of the other.)<span class="es0">\\n</span><span class="es0">\\n</span>===Video questions===<span class="es0">\\n</span>: \'\'\'\'\'Question:\'\'\'\'\' (Three video clips are demonstrated to the experts: a tractor in a field, a flying aircraft and a submarine in the sea.) A Chinese proverb says \'\'he\'\' can do everything but three things. What is \'\'his\'\' profession?<span class="es0">\\n</span>: \'\'\'\'\'Answer:\'\'\'\'\' A chef. (The proverb says he can cook of everything on the earth except for a tractor, everything in the sky except for an aircraft and everything in the sea except for a submarine.&lt;ref&gt;This is actually similar to a quote made by [[Prince Philip]] - there is no such saying in the [[Chinese language]] (see [[Cantonese cuisine]]). But indeed, another saying <span class="es0">\\u</span>201c<span class="es0">\\u</span>5929<span class="es0">\\u</span>4e0a<span class="es0">\\u</span>98de<span class="es0">\\u</span>7684<span class="es0">\\u</span>ff0c<span class="es0">\\u</span>5730<span class="es0">\\u</span>4e0a<span class="es0">\\u</span>8dd1<span class="es0">\\u</span>7684<span class="es0">\\u</span>ff0c<span class="es0">\\u</span>6c34<span class="es0">\\u</span>91cc<span class="es0">\\u</span>6e38<span class="es0">\\u</span>7684<span class="es0">\\u</span>201d ([all the animals] flying in the sky, running on the earth, swimming in the waters) is often a reference to the wide variety of animal ingredients used in Chinese cuisine, especially in Cantonese cuisine.&lt;/ref&gt;)<span class="es0">\\n</span><span class="es0">\\n</span>=== Picture-based questions ===<span class="es0">\\n</span>: \'\'\'\'\'Question:\'\'\'\'\' (An old map of [[England]] is given to the experts.) Using a map like this, [[Edmond Halley]] became the first to measure the area of each county in England.

The very first version of the game (aired September 4, 1975) emphasized knowledge rather than logic; two families competed from their homes. In the next two years only two games were aired, the second of which, on 24 December 1977, already was close to the today\'s format: a [[top]] spinning on the table selects a viewer\'s question which is discussed for one minute by a team of 6 persons; the host is <span class="es0">\\&quot;</span>invisible<span class="es0">\\&quot;</span> and present only as a voice. (At the time, Voroshilov was banned from appearing on the screen, even his name was not indicated in the show credits.) Since 1978, the game is aired regularly. The final major change in rules, in 1982, established that the game continues until 6 points are scored by either side. Since 1986, the games are broadcast [[Live television|live]].<span class="es0">\\n</span><span class="es0">\\n</span>The game quickly became popular, and a dozen or so of the best players from the TV version have become household names of the same magnitude as pop-music stars: Viktor Sidnev, Nurali Latypov, [[Alexander Drouz]], Alexei Blinov, [[Fyodor Dvinyatin]], [[Boris Burda]], [[Anatoly Wasserman]], [[Maxim Potashev]] and so on.<span class="es0">\\n</span><span class="es0">\\n</span>==International versions==<span class="es0">\\n</span>Licensed versions of the game are currently being aired throughout countries of the former USSR (like Azerbaijan and Georgia).
